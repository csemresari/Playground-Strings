 ### Multi-line String Literals (Swift 4)
 Swift now allows you to create a multi-line String literals. You wrap the strings in triple double quotes (`"""String"""`). You do not need to escape newlines and quotes within the string:

To be, or not to be - that is the question;
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

/*:
 You can control the leading white space with the indentation of the text relative to the closing `"""`. In the last example there is no leading whitespace in the final string literal. In this next example we indent the text by two spaces:
 */
let indentedText = """
Hello, this text is indented by
two spaces from the closing quotes
"""
/*:
 Source code with overly long string literals can be hard to read. To split long lines in the source use a \ to escape the new line.
 */
let singleLongLine = """
This is a single long line split \
over two lines by escaping the newline.
